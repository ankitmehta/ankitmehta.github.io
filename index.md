# Hi, I'm Ankit Mehta 👋

I'm an **Assistant Professor at [Sitare University](https://sitare.org)**, where I teach Computer Science to underprivileged students helping bridge the gap between talent and opportunity in India.

Before academia, I spent ~10 years as a software engineer at **Amazon, Google, Flipkart and Meta**, building large-scale backend and distributed systems.

I hold a **B.E. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Mathematics from BITS Pilani** (2012).

## What I'm Working On

- Teaching Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in Java: covering functional programming, design patterns, and software engineering principles
- Designing rigorous, hands-on assessments
- Exploring research directions at the intersection of systems, theory, and ML for Science
